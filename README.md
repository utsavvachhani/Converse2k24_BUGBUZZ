# CONVERSE2k24_BUGBUZZ

## Event Overview

**CONVERSE2k24_BUGBUZZ** is an exciting coding competition hosted by my college, where participants showcase their problem-solving and debugging skills in a fast-paced environment. As a contributor to this event, I played a key role in developing various coding tasks for the competition.

## Event Structure

The event consists of two rounds, each designed to challenge participants with unique coding tasks. There are 4 teams in each round, and each team is assigned 5 distinct tasks to complete.

- **Total Rounds**: 2
- **Number of Participanet**: solo
- **Teams per Round**: 4
- **Tasks per Team**: 5

The tasks span across different programming challenges aimed at testing a broad range of skills, from debugging to algorithmic thinking. Each task is carefully curated to provide a balance between complexity and learning.

## My Contribution

For **CONVERSE2k24_BUGBUZZ**, I contributed by developing the complete set of tasks for both rounds. This involved:
- **Task Design**: Creating coding problems tailored for each round, focusing on real-world debugging and problem-solving scenarios.
- **Code Implementation**: Writing and optimizing the code for various programming challenges to ensure they are clear, functional, and challenging.
- **Testing and Evaluation**: Ensuring all tasks were thoroughly tested and ready for participants to solve during the competition.

## Key Highlights:
- Developed and distributed the complete coding set for two rounds.
- Contributed to creating a competitive yet fun experience for 8 teams across 2 rounds.
- Ensured all tasks were aligned with the event goals of testing code understanding, debugging skills, and algorithmic efficiency.

## Technologies Used:
- C, C++ (TurboC), and other common debugging tools.
- Algorithms and data structure-based challenges.

## Learnings:
Working on this project allowed me to gain deeper insights into problem creation and debugging, while also enhancing my ability to design competitive tasks for a group of developers.
